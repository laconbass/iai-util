# Warning

This module is a component of [the iai framework](https://npmjs.org/search?q=iai). It's useless for you, until some serious work has been done.

# Iai Component
## A chainable API that helps building and managing modular components.

Iai components must be designed according to the following **Principles**
 * **modularity**: A Iai Component may be divided onto sub-components and so on. Those components may be Iai Components or not.
 * **laziness**: A Iai Component shouldn't load neither of its sub-components until it is loaded explicity.
 * **extensibility**: A Iai Component must extend itself with the funcionality exposed by a loaded sub-component and also provide extension hooks to allow being programatically extended.
